# CloudBasedFaceAttendace
This is a level up from my FaceAttendance project; here I've integrated cloud computing (aws), so that virtual servers can handle the entire storage and analysis portion; as a result, we no longer require any owned physical storage for the system's operation.

Additional library used:

    install boto3 (pip3 install cmake)
    install csv (pip3 install dlib)
    install keyboard
